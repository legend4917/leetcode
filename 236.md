## 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
### Description
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

**Example:**

```
        _______3______
       /              \
    ___5__          ___1__
   /      \        /      \
   6      _2       0       8
         /  \
         7   4
```

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

### Solution
递归判断即可，注意是指针相等，code如下：

```C++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if(!root || !p || !q)
            return NULL;
        if(root == p || root == q)
            return root;
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        if(left && right)
            return root;
        return left ? left : right;
    }
};
```
